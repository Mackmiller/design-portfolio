                Mackenzie's previous work across multiple industries contributes to an analytical yet creative skillset
                for learning and applying new technology, specifically for improving the usability and accessibilty of
                web-based user experiences. In her free time, she enjoys testing out various data visualization
                libraries, learning Web3, and going down the occasional blackhole about algorithmic musical composition.

              <p>
                Mackenzie holds two degrees from the University of Miami, most recently a Master of Fine Arts with
                emphasis in data visualization and user experience design. Her research and projects during this degree
                revolved around applying user-centered design to the development of data-driven web applications and
                physical computing topics. After graduation, Mackenzie consulted as a visual communications designer
                primarily for US-based nonprofits, and her work has been utilized in the continental US, Europe, and
                Africa. In addition to her role in these projects as lead designer/coder, Mackenzie enjoyed gaining
                valuable project manager experience.

              <p>
                Prior to her masters, Mackenzie graduated from the Frost School of Music at the University of Miami,
                where she received her Bachelor of Music in Instrumental Performance. While living in South Florida for
                eight years, Mackenzie was an active flute soloist and pedagogue, maintaining a virtual and in-person
                flute studio consisting of students ages 8 to 85. In addition to her formal training at UM, Mackenzie
                worked with international flute soloist Sir James Galway from 2017-2019 in Switzerland, where she was a
                flute soloist and artistic administrator at his summer institute.</p>
