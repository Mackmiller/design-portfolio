                As a classically trained musician, the “future” of classical music was always on my mind. I had always
                heard about facts and figures that painted a dismal scene for the classical music industry in coming
                years. During my masters, I had the opportunity to use Google trends for finding search data that would
                support or disprove this notion. The general trend showed decrease search interest in classical music
                over time, and it also exposed the seasonal popularity trends that occurred in each yearly cycle.

                My professor told me that I could create a music performance using anything I learned from my
                undergraduate experience. Anything? I asked.

                I decided to put a spin on a traditional music performance by changing up the method of accompaniment:
                13 oranges taking place of a piano or harpsichord. Blending the old (baroque music) with the new (sense
                technology). I had to come up with a system of coordinating each specific musical pitch with a
                corresponding orange using MakeyMakey technology. I used colors to connect the oranges with the notes on
                the page.

                The performance was from JS Bach Sonata in C major. Flutist: Caroline Schaffer. This video is from a
                concert at the University of Miami, featuring the first forty seconds of the piece. </p>

                created a great combination of related visuals and data, without being too text heavy or number heavy.
                The custom maps combined several sources of data: state-designated cougar habitat and various incident
                types involving humans and cougars at state and county level.</p>

                expressed interest in using these 3D replicas for various projects. I designed and created a Unity app
                that uses those target images to display the 3D replicas with audio accompaniment. We thought it was

                As a student walking around the Coral Gables campus, Emergency Blue Light Phones are constantly part of
                the landscape we walk around in, even if we don’t directly interact with them most of the time. However,
                it is comforting to know that the UM Police will be right with you at the quick dial of one of those
                phones in any uncomfortable situation.

                I wanted to map all the locations of the Emergency Blue Light Phones on the Coral Gables campus so that
                students can find the closest telephone to them at any given place on campus. This interactive map could
                have a home in the UMiami mobile app, which is used by hundreds of students daily for various schedules,

                This was the first time that I utilized physical computing for the purpose of a museum exhibit. I had
                the opportunity to participate in the Accelerate Festival at the Smithsonian in Washington, DC.

                I created a button interface using Arduino technology accompanied by beautiful videography of the
                Everglades that would allow people of all ages and accessibility levels to become immersed by the sounds
                of the Everglades. I used real wood for the platform bases of the buttons, which added an unexpected but
                most welcome earthy aroma to the installation. The buttons were categorized into land animals, sky
                animals, and environmental noises. </p>

                One of my nonprofit clients was interested in visualizing their quarterly updates in a infographic
                spread, instead of a traditional report. We were able to pull in elements from various visualization
                tools, such as a map, timeline, photos, etc. so that the US-based stakeholders would have a better
                visual sense of how their nonprofit was directly impacting projects in Central Africa.
